# FILENAME:
# SPOAllSitesAndSubsitesPlusOwners.ps1
#
# INFO:
# This PowerShell script is for SharePoint Online Service and it can be used to export a list of
# all of the sites and subsites and associated owners
#
# NOTE:
# If you have some naming standard for owner groups across all of your SPO sites - please adjust
# the filter on line 52, or at least set it to "Sharing*" to filter out SharingLinks, or you will
# have to iterate through all of the groups and sharing links an this will take forever!
#
# DEPENDENCY:
# This script employs additional module called SharePointPnPPowerShellOnline, you can install that
# from PS online library using following command:
#  > Install-Module SharePointPnPPowerShellOnline
#
# More info here:
